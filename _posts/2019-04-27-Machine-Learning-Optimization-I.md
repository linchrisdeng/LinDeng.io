## Introduction

Before talking about optimization in Machine Learning we need to clarify a question: 

> A: What does a machine learn?
>
> B: Algorithms! Supervised/Unsupervised Learning! KNN, Naive Bayes! Trees!
>
> A: Well, these are what we human beings need to learn. The question is WHAT does a MACHINE LEARN?
>
> B: I am not sure about your problem...
>
> A: **PARAMETERS!**

Before we start talking about how machine learn parameters, we trully need to review some mathmatics.
